## 🛡️ Security & Access Audit (IAM/SSO)

A high-fidelity security assessment to establish professional access protocols and compliance guardrails across your AWS environment, ensuring you meet enterprise standards and minimize organizational risk.

- **Implement IAM Identity Center (SSO):** Full review and establishment of SSO/Federation best practices to simplify access and remove reliance on insecure IAM users.
- **Stale Access Remediation:** Identify and revoke unused or over-privileged access keys and roles, including the secure separation of duties.
- **HIPAA/SOC 2 Assessment:** Review your current system's compliance posture and provide immediate, actionable fixes for mandated security controls and auditing protocols.
- **Secure Deployment:** Establish patterns for secure service interaction and deployment methods your developers can trust.

## 💰 Cost Optimization & Serverless Review

Analyze and refine your existing AWS Serverless architecture to find immediate cost savings, improve performance, and ensure your services are designed to scale efficiently or "spin down to zero" when not in use.

- **Deep-Dive Service Audit:** Comprehensive review of core cost centers: Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, SQS/SNS configuration, and API Gateway usage.
- **Cost-Optimized Architecture:** Restructure expensive patterns into event-driven, cost-efficient models (e.g., leveraging Fargate Spot or reserved concurrency strategies).
- **Performance Bottleneck Correction:** Identify and correct configurations that lead to unnecessary latency or resource over-provisioning (e.g., cold starts, inefficient database queries).
- **Actionable Cost Plan:** Deliver a clear, prioritized document outlining exactly where and how to minimize idle cloud spend without sacrificing reliability.
