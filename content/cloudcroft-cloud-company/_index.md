I'm offering up to 2 days of hands-on, CTO-level AWS work for a flat $500 — a special for my 10th re:Invent to gain my first 10 freelance clients on upWork. This offer ends after I book my 10th satisfied client. Secure senior advisory and execution (100+ AWS services deployed to production) at a flat rate, GenAI work at 90% off to reflect my ability to provide architectures of 90% savings, and for not-for-profits I am offering 4 hours of expert AWS insights for only $6- the smallest amount upWork will allow me to charge.

Reasonable ongoing maintenance rates available for satisfied clients and not-for-profits; $222/hr generally.
