# 🔒 Website Security & Resilience Roadmap

A clear, easy-to-follow framework that helps your organization move from unexpected website issues to steady, confident control. This service strengthens your digital infrastructure, protects sensitive information, and ensures your site runs smoothly — all while aligning improvements with your budget and goals.

## Active Remediation & Prevention

**Infrastructure Hardening**: Identifies outdated software and components that attackers commonly target, then updates or replaces them to close those gaps before they become problems.

**Access Governance**: Secures administrative entry points so only authorized people can make changes, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious modifications.

**Traffic Optimization**: Filters out bots, scrapers, and other non-human traffic that slow down your site, distort analytics, and increase hosting costs.

**Encrypted Connectivity**: Fixes browser warning screens and configuration errors so every visitor experiences a secure, trustworthy connection.

## What you get

**Environment Health Scan**: A thorough review that uncovers hidden risks, outdated systems, and performance issues that may not be visible from the outside.

**Immediate Risk Remediation**: Direct action to resolve high-priority vulnerabilities, speed bottlenecks, and recurring stability problems.

**Right-Sized Security Strategy**: Practical, budget-conscious recommendations for tools like traffic filters, secure login systems, and protective services that match your organization's scale.

**Continuous Visibility**: Clear, executive-friendly reporting and ongoing maintenance so you always know your website's health and what's being handled behind the scenes.
