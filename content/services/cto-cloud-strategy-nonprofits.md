Before we meet, you'll share a bit of background so I understand your goals, pain points, and constraints. During the session, we walk through what's working, what isn't, and where the biggest opportunities are. The conversation stays grounded in plain language and practical steps — no jargon, no pressure to "go big," and no assumptions about your technical capacity.

Afterward, you receive a clear, research‑backed summary that outlines what we discussed and the most realistic next steps. It's written so you can hand it to a board member, a program lead, or a funder and they'll understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish.

You can use the session in whatever way serves you best. If your website feels slow, confusing, or outdated, we can focus on improving speed, clarity, accessibility, content, or security. If you're wrestling with hosting costs or reliability, we can look at your AWS setup and talk through simpler, more cost‑effective patterns. And if you're curious about AI — whether for document search, supporter questions, or internal workflows — we can explore what's actually feasible and safe for an organization your size.

The goal is simple: give you clarity, confidence, and a practical path forward, whether that's improving your site, modernizing your infrastructure, or exploring responsible AI. You decide how to use the time, and you walk away with a plan that fits your mission and your capacity.
