## About Bryan Chasko 🚀
[🔝 Return to Top](#top)

I am a mission-driven technology leader and **AWS Hero** applying **digital-first strategies** in software, data pipelines, AI, and automation. My expertise lies in designing and deploying systems across diverse, mission-critical sectors including healthcare, education, utilities, and rural connectivity.

My professional focus centers on transforming complex business logic into reliable systems with accessible interfaces. My career is defined by technical innovation and leadership across four distinct phases:

* **Cloudcroft Cloud Company:** Delivering strategic project execution and cutting-edge cloud implementation. This encompasses contract leadership in **Education (Alamogordo Public Schools)** and **Telecommunications (Tularosa Communications)**, providing infrastructure and connectivity solutions.
* **X2nSat:** Architecting streaming and satellite connectivity solutions in a high-tech environment, bridging the gap between orbit and earth.
* **Electronic Caregiver (ECG):** Leading the transformation of patient care through telehealth and remote monitoring technology, scaling solutions from local prototypes to enterprise health systems.
* **US Army:** Managing mission-critical systems, logistics, and advanced protection gear in high-stakes defense operations.

Recognized as an **AWS Hero** since 2018, I actively organize tech and design communities while guiding teams through **servant leadership**—removing barriers, fostering collaboration, and ensuring innovation reaches production. I utilize cloud abstractions as a core technical strength, allowing a focus on unique mission needs by deploying over **100 AWS services in production** across healthcare, education, utilities, agriculture, defense, and space.

I have forged strategic collaborations with **Google, Dell, Intel, and Amazon** to scale solutions in both private and public domains, and partnered with the **Department of Energy and U.S. national laboratories** to advance projects in energy, climate modeling, and resilient infrastructure.

Connecting globally and locally as a speaker and organizer, including leading **AWS User Group RGC3** (El Paso, TX) and **Blender UG NE3D** (Boston), I continue to explore GenAI, robotics, digital twins, and satellite data pipelines with a focus on solutions for **underserved and rural communities**.
