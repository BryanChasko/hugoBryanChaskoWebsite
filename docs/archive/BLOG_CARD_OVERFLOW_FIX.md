# Blog Card Text Cutoff Fix

## ✅ FIXED: Text No Longer Gets Cut Off

### Root Cause Identified

The `.post-entry` container had `overflow: hidden` which was clipping text content that extended beyond the container boundaries.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Removed `overflow: hidden` from `.post-entry`** ✅
```css
/* BEFORE */
.post-entry {
  ...
  overflow: hidden;  /* ❌ This was cutting off text */
  ...
}

/* AFTER */
.post-entry {
  ...
  /* overflow: hidden removed */
  ...
}
```

#### 2. **Removed Duplicate CSS Rule** ✅
Cleaned up duplicate `.post-entry .entry-content` rule that was appearing after the responsive media queries.

### Why This Fixes the Issue

- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card container was clipping any content that extended beyond the calculated height
- Even though we removed `line-clamp`, the container itself was still hiding overflow
- Removing this allows text to flow naturally and display completely

### What's Preserved

✅ **Border radius** - Still works without overflow hidden  
✅ **Backdrop filter** - Glassmorphism effect intact  
✅ **Box shadows** - All depth effects preserved  
✅ **Gradient backgrounds** - Visual styling maintained  
✅ **Responsive behavior** - All breakpoints working  

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Long text content displays fully (no cutoff)
- [ ] Short text content still looks good
- [ ] Border radius still clips background properly
- [ ] Glassmorphism effects still visible
- [ ] No layout breaks on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Text wraps naturally without truncation
